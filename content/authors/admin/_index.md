I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the {{< staticref "https://cogandbrainlab.web.illinois.edu/" "newtab" >}}Cognition and Brain Laboratory{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Previously, I was a {{< staticref "https://beckman.illinois.edu/" "newtab" >}}Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellow{{< /staticref >}}, and before that I was a postdoctoral researcher at {{< staticref "https://www.hrl.com/laboratories/issl/" "newtab" >}}HRL Laboratories{{< /staticref >}}.

I am primarily interested in the cognitive neuroscience of language and memory, and study these processes using psychological experiments in conjunction with electrophysiological recordings and analyses. Additionally, I am interested in how these mechanisms change with age, as well as how they are influenced by strategies or metacognitive processes. My research career has led to many secondary interests, including attention, sleep, neurostimulation, and EEG analysis methods. I consider myself a Collaborative Cognitive Neuroscientist, and working with other scientists to answer interesting questions is one of my favorite aspects of research.
