abstract: "Psychological and neuroscientific experiments have established that
  people can intentionally forget information via different strategies: direct
  suppression and thought substitution. However, few studies have directly
  compared the effectiveness of these strategies in forgetting specific items,
  and it remains an open question if the neural mechanisms supporting these
  strategies differ. Here, we developed a novel item-method directed forgetting
  paradigm with Remember, Forget, and Imagine cues, and recorded EEG to directly
  compare these strategies. Behaviorally, Forget and Imagine cues produced
  similar forgetting compared to Remember cues, but through separable neural
  processes; Forget cues elicited frontal oscillatory power changes that were
  predictive of future forgetting, whereas item-cue representational similarity
  was predictive of later accuracy for Imagine cues. These results suggest that
  both strategies can lead to intentional forgetting, but directed forgetting
  may rely on frontally-mediated suppression, while thought substitution may
  lead to contextual shifting, impairing successful retrieval."
