abstract: The control of vocal pitch plays a central role in speech and singing,
  where accurate tonal production relies on modulating F0 production. Previous
  research has shown that vocal pitch is modulated in response to artificial
  pitch perturbations during ongoing vocalization (i.e., the pitch-shift
  response) with response characteristics differing between musicians and
  non-musicians. However, little is known about the behavior of these responses
  in the higher portion of a speaker's vocal range for amateur musicians or
  non-musicians. The present study addresses whether pitch control changes as
  target pitch is systematically increased and whether this variation is
  affected by musicianship. We predicted that as F0 moves away from comfortable
  speaking level, pitch-shift response peak amplitude would increase and peak
  latency would decrease, while participants with musical experience would have
  lower amplitude responses than those without experience. Results showed that
  peak amplitude linearly increased as F0 was raised, and that peak latency
  similarly decreased but with more variability. However, musical participants
  had larger pitch-shift response amplitudes and longer peak latency times than
  non-musical participants, which is an unanticipated finding for persons with
  musical training. These patterns suggest that pitch control can be manipulated
  by vocal tasks that vary F0 while still being subject to strong modulation by
  musical background.
