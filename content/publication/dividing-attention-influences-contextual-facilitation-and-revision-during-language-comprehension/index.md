abstract: Although we often seem to successfully comprehend language in the face
  of distraction, few studies have examined the role of sustained attention in
  critical components of sentence processing, such as integrating information
  over a sentence and revising predictions when unexpected information is
  encountered. The current study investigated the impact of attention on
  sentence processing using a novel dual-task paradigm. Participants read weakly
  and strongly constraining sentences with expected or unexpected endings while
  also tracking the motion of dots in the background, and their EEG was
  recorded. Under full attention, the amplitude of the N400 component of the
  ERP, a measure of semantic access, was reduced (facilitated) in a graded
  fashion by contextual strength and fit. This context-based facilitation was
  attenuated when attention was divided, suggesting that sustained attention is
  important for building up message-level representations. In contrast, the
  post-N400 frontal positivity that has been observed to prediction violations
  and associated with revision processes was unaffected by dividing attention.
  However, under divided attention, participants also elicited
  posteriorly-distributed effects to these violations. Thus, predictive
  processes seem to be engaged even when attention is divided, but additional
  resources may then be required to process unexpected information.
