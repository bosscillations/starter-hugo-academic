abstract: Virtual reality presents exciting new prospects for the delivery of
  educational materials to students. By combining this technology with
  biological sensors, a student in a virtual educational environment can be
  monitored for physiological markers of engagement or more cognitive states of
  learning. With this information, the virtual reality environment can be
  adaptively altered to reflect the student's state, essentially creating a
  closed-loop feedback system. This paper explores these concepts, and presents
  preliminary data on a combined EEG-VR working memory experiment as a first
  step toward a broader implementation of an intelligent adaptive learning
  system. This first-pass neural time-series and oscillatory data suggest that
  while an EEG-based neurofeedback system is feasible, more work on removing
  artifacts and identifying relevant and important features will lead to higher
  prediction accuracy.
