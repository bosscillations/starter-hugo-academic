abstract: "Predicting upcoming events is a critical function of the brain, and
  language provides a fertile testing ground for studying prediction, as
  comprehenders use context to predict features of upcoming words. Many aspects
  of the mechanisms of prediction remain elusive, partly due to a lack of
  methodological tools to probe prediction formation in the moment. To elucidate
  what features are neurally preactivated and when, we used representational
  similarity analysis on previously collected sentence reading data. We compared
  EEG activity patterns elicited by expected and unexpected sentence final words
  to patterns from the preceding words of the sentence, in both strongly and
  weakly constraining sentences. Pattern similarity with the final word was
  increased in an early time window following the presentation of the pre-final
  word, and this increase was modulated by both expectancy and constraint. This
  was not seen at earlier words, suggesting that predictions were precisely
  timed. Additionally, pre-final word activity—the predicted representation—had
  negative similarity with later final word activity, but only for strongly
  expected words. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of prediction in
  the brain: rapid preactivation occurs following certain cues, but the
  predicted features may receive reduced processing upon confirmation."
