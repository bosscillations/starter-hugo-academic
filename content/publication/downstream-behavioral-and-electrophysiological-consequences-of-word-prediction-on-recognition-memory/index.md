abstract: When people process language, they can use context to predict upcoming
  information, influencing processing and comprehension as seen in both
  behavioral and neural measures. Although numerous studies have shown immediate
  facilitative effects of confirmed predictions, the downstream consequences of
  prediction have been less explored. In the current study, we examined those
  consequences by probing participants’ recognition memory for words after they
  read sets of sentences. Participants read strongly and weakly constraining
  sentences with expected or unexpected endings (“I added my name to the
  list/basket”), and later were tested on their memory for the sentence endings
  while EEG was recorded. Critically, the memory test contained words that were
  predictable (“list”) but were never read (participants saw “basket”).
  Behaviorally, participants showed successful discrimination between old and
  new items, but false alarmed to the expected-item lures more often than to new
  items, showing that predicted words or concepts can linger, even when
  predictions are disconfirmed. Although false alarm rates did not differ by
  constraint, event-related potentials (ERPs) differed between false alarms to
  strongly and weakly predictable words. Additionally, previously unexpected
  (compared to previously expected) endings that appeared on the memory test
  elicited larger N1 and LPC amplitudes, suggesting greater attention and
  episodic recollection. In contrast, highly predictable sentence endings that
  had been read elicited reduced LPC amplitudes during the memory test. Thus,
  prediction can facilitate processing in the moment, but can also lead to false
  memory and reduced recollection for predictable information.
