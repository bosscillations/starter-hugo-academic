abstract: When meaningful stimuli such as words are encountered in groups or
  pairs (e.g., “elephant-ferry”), they can be processed either separately or as
  an integrated concept (“an elephant ferry”). Prior research suggests that
  memory for integrated associations is supported by different mechanisms than
  is memory for nonintegrated associations. However, little is known about the
  neurocognitive mechanisms that support the integration of novel stimulus
  pairs. We recorded ERPs while participants memorized sequentially presented,
  unrelated noun pairs using a strategy that either did or did not involve
  attempting to construct coherent definitions. We varied the concreteness of
  the first noun in each pair to examine whether conceptual combination
  instructions would induce compositional concreteness effects, or differences
  in ERPs evoked by the second noun as a function of the concreteness of the
  first noun. We found that the conceptual combination task, but not the
  noncombinatory encoding task, produced compositional concreteness effects on a
  late frontal negativity previously linked to visual imagery. Moreover, word
  pairs studied under conceptual combination instructions showed evidence of
  more unitized or holistic memory representations on associative recognition
  and free recall tests. Finally, item analyses indicated that (a) items with
  higher normed imageability ratings were rated by participants as easier to
  conceptually combine, and (b) in the conceptual combination task,
  ease-of-combination ratings mediated an indirect relationship between
  imageability and subsequent associative memory. These data are suggestive of a
  role of compositional imagery in the online formation of novel concepts via
  conceptual combination.
