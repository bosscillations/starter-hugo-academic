abstract: It is well-established that aging impairs memory for associations more
  than it does memory for single items. Aging also impacts processes involved in
  online language comprehension, including the ability to form integrated,
  message-level representations. These changes in comprehension processes could
  impact older adults’ associative memory performance, perhaps by reducing or
  altering the effectiveness of encoding strategies that encourage semantic
  integration. The present study examined age differences in the use of a
  strategy termed conceptual combination, which involves integrating two words
  (e.g., “winter” and “salad”) into a single concept (“a salad for winter”). We
  recorded ERPs while participants studied unrelated noun pairs using a strategy
  that either did or did not encourage conceptual combination. We also varied
  the concreteness of the first noun in each pair in order to measure
  compositional concreteness effects, or ERP differences at the second noun due
  to the concreteness of the first noun. At the first nouns, older adults showed
  word-level concreteness effects that were similar to those of younger adults.
  However, compositional concreteness effects were diminished in older adults,
  consistent with reduced semantic integration. Older adults’ associative memory
  performance was better for word pairs studied during the conceptual
  combination task versus the non-combinatory encoding task; however, the
  magnitude of the age-related associative memory deficit did not differ between
  tasks. Finally, analyses of both memory accuracy and trial-by-trial ratings of
  perceived combination success suggested that older adults had disproportionate
  difficulty applying the conceptual combination strategy to word pairs that
  began with abstract nouns. Overall, these results indicate that changes to
  integrative language processing that occur with age are not independent of –
  and may sometimes exacerbate – age-related memory decline.
