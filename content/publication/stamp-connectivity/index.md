abstract: Metamemory involves the ability to correctly judge the accuracy of our
  memories. The retrieval of memories can be improved using transcranial
  electrical stimulation (tES) during sleep, but evidence for improvements to
  metamemory sensitivity is limited. Applying tES can enhance sleep-dependent
  memory consolidation, which along with metamemory requires the coordination of
  activity across distributed neural systems, suggesting that examining
  functional connectivity is important for understanding these processes.
  Nevertheless, little research has examined how functional connectivity
  modulations relate to overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. Here, we
  developed a closed-loop short-duration tES method, time-locked to up-states of
  ongoing slow-wave oscillations, to cue specific memory replays in humans. We
  measured electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence changes following stimulation
  pulses, and characterized network alterations with graph theoretic metrics.
  Using machine learning techniques, we show that pulsed tES elicited network
  changes in multiple frequency bands, including increased connectivity in the
  theta band and increased efficiency in the spindle band. Additionally,
  stimulation-induced changes in beta-band path length were predictive of
  overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. These findings add new insights
  into the growing literature investigating increases in memory performance
  through brain stimulation during sleep, and highlight the importance of
  examining functional connectivity to explain its effects.
